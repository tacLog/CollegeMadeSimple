	Used app like a normal would user. Filled in all fields in
	the app with different amounts numbers and categories also 
	with different amounts of numbers. Constantly changed 
	between fragments and activties to see if a crash would 
	occur. played with menus and navigation drawers 
	constantly to ensure no lag occurred. Chose all items on 
	navigation drawer to ensure all send to correct form and 
	were saved in apporpriate variable. Overall just played 
	with entire app and had friends try as well to have different
	people and their usages be tested.
