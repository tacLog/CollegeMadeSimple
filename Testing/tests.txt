Michael:
	Used app like a normal would user. Filled in all fields in
	the app with different amounts numbers and categories also 
	with different amounts of numbers. Constantly changed 
	between fragments and activties to see if a crash would 
	occur. played with menus and navigation drawers 
	constantly to ensure no lag occurred. Chose all items on 
	navigation drawer to ensure all send to correct form and 
	were saved in apporpriate variable. Overall just played 
	with entire app and had friends try as well to have different
	people and their usages be tested.
Eduardo:
	I tested the usability of the app. I tested how reliable the
	app actually is. I tested the menu and checked if each of the buttons
	worked and did what they were suppose to do. The button I mostly focused
	on was the help button. The button lead to a page with other buttons and
	I made sure those buttons lead to the right information based on which
	financial aid the user wanted to learn more about. Checked
	if the app ran smoothly and if there were any crashes or lags in the program.
	Played with the input a bit to see if the app was saving data, such as picking
	semester or quarter system.
